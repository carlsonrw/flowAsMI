# A computational theory of flow

Here we provide task files used in Experiments 1-5 for the paper "[A computational theory of flow](https://psyarxiv.com/9q3jd)" (Melnikoff, Carlson, & Stillman, 2022). All experiments were run using jsPsych 6.1.0. Each Experiment can be taken at carlsonrw.github.io/flowAsMI/exp[#]. For instance, to launch Experiment 1, navigate to  [carlsonrw.github.io/flowAsMI/exp1](carlsonrw.github.io/flowAsMI/exp1). Alternatively, you can download each experiment's repo and launch the index.html file locally.

If you have any questions, or find any bugs, please feel free to email me at ryan.carlson@yale.edu.
