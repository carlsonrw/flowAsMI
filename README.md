# A computational theory of flow

Here we provide task files used in Experiment 1, 2, and 3 for the paper "[A computational theory of flow](https://psyarxiv.com/9q3jd)" (Melnikoff, Carlson, & Stillman, submitted). All experiments were run using jsPsych 6.1.0. Each experiment can be run by downloading this repo and launching the experiment's html file in a code editor that allows for live previews (e.g., Brackets). 

If you have any questions, or find any bugs, please feel free to email me at ryan.carlson@yale.edu.
