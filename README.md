# A computational theory of flow

Here we provide task files used in Experiments 1-5 for the paper "[A computational theory of flow](https://psyarxiv.com/9q3jd)" (Melnikoff, Carlson, & Stillman, 2022). All experiments were run using jsPsych 6.1.0. Each experiment can be taken below. Or, to run each experiment locally, you can download this repo and double-click the index.html within each experiment's folder.
